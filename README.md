# My School Website Web Application

A comprehnsive school website web application built from scratch using Spring, Spring MVC,  Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, Spring JDBC , Spring Data . and JPA.  The application is deployed to AWS Beanstalk for cloud hosting.

## Introduction 

I developed this school website web application as part of my learning journey to master various technologies such as Spring, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in building RESTful services , integrating databases, and deploying applications to the cloud.  


## Project Overview

This project is a school website web application designed to facilate various services , I developed the project from scratch , implementing various technologies and integrating them to create a cohesive application.

## Technologies Used

1) Spring Framework 
2) Spring Boot 
3) Different projects inside Spring
5) Spring Core Concepts like Inversion of Control (IoC), Dependency Injection (DI) & Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)
6) Bean Scopes inside Spring framework
7) Autowiring of the Spring Beans
8) Lombok library and Annotations
9) Spring MVC 
10) Thymeleaf
11) Spring MVC Validations
12) build dynamic web apps using Thymeleaf & Spring
13) Thymeleaf integration with Spring, Spring MVC, Spring Security
14) Deep dive on Spring Boot, Auto-configuration
15) Spring Boot Dev Tools
16) Spring Boot H2 Database
17) Securing web applications using Spring Security
18) Authentication , Authorization, Role based access
19) Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) & Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
20) Database create, read, update, delete operations using Spring JDBC
21) Use ORM frameworks & database create, read, update, delete operations using Spring Data JPA/Hibernate
22) Derived Query methods in JPA
23) OneToOne, OneToMany, ManyToOne, ManyToMany mappings inside JPA/Hibernate
24) Sorting, Pagination, JPQL inside Spring Data JPA
25) Building Rest Services inside Spring
26) Consuming Rest Services using OpenFeign, Web Client, RestTemplate
27) Spring Data Rest & HAL Explorer

30) Profiles inside Spring Boot applications
31) Conditional Bean creation using Profiles
32) Monitoring Spring Boot applications using SpringBoot Actuator & Spring Boot Admin
33) Deploying SpringBoot App into cloud using AWS Elastic Beanstalk

I learned these technologies through a Udemy course but implemented them independentaly to develop this project from scratch.
